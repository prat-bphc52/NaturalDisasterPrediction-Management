# NATURAL DISASTER PREDICTION AND MANAGEMENT
Natural disaster can be predicted by using data mining and neural networks by use of satellite imaging,hydraulic sensors.
There are many techniques which are already being used for the prediction of natural disaster.


# Making an android app which predict and help in managing the resources.

Facilities provided by apps:-
1.Disaster alerts via sms,alarms.
2.Shows you the nearest route to the safe-sites (place where person is safe).
3.Connect person, security guards,military and government under the common network so it is easy to help and communicate each other.  
4.Provide the quick alerts when there is shortage of food items and other things in emergency stores.
5.Give the total estimate of resources(food,water,tents,etc), needed for persons who are in threat.
6.Also maintain portal for donations so that needy people get maximum help.

Functioning of android app:-
The app will first fetch the location of the user. Using this location the app will collect the history of that particular location. For ex, let us assume an user living in Kerala which has chances of being hit by floods. Thus in this case we shall collect the associated data for Flood, such as weather conditions, precipitation chances etc, from various meteorological departments. Secondly we will also collect the sample data from the past when some natural disaster had occurred in Kerala. We shall use this sample data to train our Machine Learning algorithm. Next we will continuously fetch the current data of the place (Kerala) and compare it with the past sample data. Using this relation we would be able to predict the possibility of any natural disaster in the near future. 

With regard to the management of situation in case if a natural disaster has occurred in the neighbourhood of the user, we shall mark certain safe locations in the map where the user can proceed for his/her safety. For ex in case of floods, it would be best to search for high grounds in the city or neighbourhood. We shall also display routes avoiding any obstruction, so that the user can safely reach the safe locations from their current location.
